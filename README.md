# &#127758; **Projeto - FCxLabs 2021 (Frontend)**

<br>

## &#128187; **Technologies**

- [Next.js (v11)](https://nextjs.org/docs), a complete development framework based on React.
- [TypeScript (v4.3)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), a empowered version of JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS (v2.2)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), a CSS framework to optimize the customization process of HTML elements.

<br>

## &#128194; **Architecture**

All major project files are inside [./](root) folder.

1. [src/components](src/components): here is everything visual you see in this project, login screen component and users' table.

2. [src/pages](src/pages): there are 2 pages:
   Pages are named as:

   - [index](src/pages/index.tsx) (login screen);
   - [main](src/pages/main.tsx) (where you'll the list of users).
     <br>

3. [src/public](src/public): page icons.
   <br>

4. [src/styles](src/styles): CSS/customization settings (linked to Tailwind CSS).

<br>

## &#9198; **Version Control**

In order to keep the code updated and track modifications, I've used [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) (VCS) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/) (for remote storage).

<br>

## &#9203; **Running**

In this topic I encourage you to take a quick look on how npm scripts and terminal script works.

> **Note:** Remember to **install dependencies** before anything. You can either do it by using `npm install` or `yarn` (if you like cats &#128571;).

- To run locally: `npm run dev` or you can alternatively run `bash run_local.sh` (convenience script I made);
- Building: `npm run build` and then `npm run start`.
